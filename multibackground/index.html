<p>Tutorials Point originated from the idea that there exists a class of readers who respond better to
online content and prefer to learn new skills at their own pace from the comforts of their drawing rooms. The
journey commenced with a single tutorial on HTML in 2006 and elated by the response it generated, we
worked our way to adding fresh tutorials to our repository which now proudly flaunts a wealth of tutorials and
allied articles on topics ranging from programming languages to web designing to academics and much
more..</p>
